# Simpson's 1/3
## What is Simpson's 1/3?
Simpson's 1/3 rule is a numerical way to integrate a set of data points. The function will only run if the "x" or independent values are equal to the "y" or dependent values.
## Inside the Algorithm
### Inputs
The two inputs of the algorithm are the independent and dependent variable.
### Outputs
The single output of the function is the calculated value of the integral.
## Function Limitations
The biggest limitation of the function is that the 1/3 rule works best on evely spaced data points. When the data is unevenly spaced the function automatically used the trapizoidal rule for the last section of the data. While comparing the analytical and numerical solutions the largest ammount of error will come out of having to use another method.
