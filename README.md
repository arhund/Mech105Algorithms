# Mech105Algorithms
## Overview
As briefly stated, this repository contians both functions and algorithms developed in the spring 2018 semester of numerical methods. All code was written in MATLAB using the function option, then tested using a new script. The following information is just the basics on the code. More details are located in the READMEs in each of the folders.  
## Functions
### Days
The day function takes the date and whether or not the year is a leap year and outputs how many days have passed since December 31 of the past year. 
### Bisect
The bisect function is a precursor to the False Position function. Bisect is a root finding method that takes values on either side of the root and moves closer to the actual value with each itteration.
## Algorithms
### False Position
The False Position function is another root finding method that also uses two points on either side of the root and moves closer with each itteration. The main difference between False Position and Bisection is one point stays consistant as the second point moves closer and closer to the actual root. 
### Simpson's 1/3
Simpson's 1/3 is a way to numerically integrate function. This algorithm works best (most accurately) if the data is evenly spaced.  
### LU Factorization
LU Factorization decomposes a sqare matrix into a lower, upper, and permutation matrix. The factroization can then be used to find the inverse of the matrix.
