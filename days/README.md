# Days Function
## What is Days?
Days is a function that takes the date (month and day) and whether or not the year was a leap year and outputs how many days have elapsed.
## Inside the Function
### Inputs
1. mo: the month in questions
2. da: the day you are looking for. Such as 4, 21, 31, etc.
3. leap: is the year in question a leap year?
### Outputs
1. nd: The only output of the function is the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year.
## Funtion limitations
The biggest limitations of the funtion is that it doesn't account for any other calendars than the convential on used in the US. The code would not be terribly hard to change but you would have to be careful.
